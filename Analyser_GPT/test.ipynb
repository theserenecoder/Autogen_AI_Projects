    "\n",
    "1.  **Formulate a Data Analysis Plan:**\n",

    "    * **After successfully generating all plots, your final `print()` statement MUST list the filenames of ALL generated `.png` files, separated by commas, in a specific format.**\n",
    "        * **Format Example for a single file:** `print(\"Generated_Images: my_plot.png\")`\n",
